## Owensfield: absolute system rules (authoritative)

These rules apply to all work in this repo unless a task explicitly says otherwise.

### Product spec authority
- **Master Specification v1.0 (Locked)** is authoritative.
- `docs/PERMISSIONS_AND_FAILURES.md` is authoritative for permissions + failure scenarios.
- If there is any conflict, **the spec wins**.
- If something is not described, **do not invent it**.

### Prohibited features (non-negotiable)
- **No discussion functionality**: no comments, replies, chat, forums, or debate threads.
- **No implicit admin powers**: every action must be explicitly permitted by role.

### Archive-only / non-destructive data
- **Never hard-delete governance data**.
- Use **status fields** and **`archived_at` timestamps**.
- Archived items are **read-only** and must remain accessible.

### Membership gating
- **Inactive members** may access **only**:
  - Profile
  - Renewal / reactivation
- Inactive members must not be able to view any protected content (documents, polls, meetings, governance, communications, finance, notices, actions).

### Enforcement principles
- Do **not** rely on frontend-only checks.
- Prefer **DB-side enforcement** (RLS, triggers, RPC) + server middleware for routing.
- All approvals and overrides must be **auditable**.

### Change discipline
- Do not add new features or workflows beyond the task.
- Keep changes minimal and scoped.
- Maintain existing behavior unless a task explicitly changes it.
