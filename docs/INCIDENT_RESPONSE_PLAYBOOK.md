# Owensfield Community Platform  
## Incident Response Playbook  
### Version 1.0 (Aligned to Master Specification v1.0 — Locked)

---

## 1. Purpose of This Playbook

This playbook defines **how the Representative Group (RG) responds to incidents** affecting governance, data integrity, or platform operation.

It is designed to:
- Prevent panic responses
- Avoid unauthorised power use
- Preserve auditability and trust
- Ensure continuity of governance

This playbook does **not** grant new powers.  
It explains how to use **existing, approved mechanisms** correctly.

## 2. Core Principles During an Incident

During any incident:

1. **Do not bypass the system**
2. **Do not delete records**
3. **Do not act alone unless Temporary Mode allows it**
4. **Assume everything is logged**

If the platform blocks an action, that is intentional.

## 3. Incident Classification

All incidents should be classified before action is taken.

### 3.1 Governance Incidents
Examples:
- RG drops below quorum
- Disputed election outcome
- Role vacancy at a critical time
- Poll outcome challenged

---

### 3.2 Operational Incidents
Examples:
- Treasurer unavailable
- AGM date entered incorrectly
- Document uploaded to wrong folder
- Action marked complete in error

---

### 3.3 Technical / Platform Incidents
Examples:
- User cannot log in
- Permission appears incorrect
- Scheduled task (annual report) did not run
- Data appears missing (but is archived)

---

## 4. Immediate Response Checklist (All Incidents)

Before doing anything else:

- [ ] Identify incident type (Governance / Operational / Technical)
- [ ] Identify who is affected
- [ ] Check audit logs
- [ ] Confirm whether Temporary Mode is active
- [ ] Confirm whether the issue is **real** or **expected behaviour**

Many “incidents” are expected enforcement.
