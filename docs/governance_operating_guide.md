## 2. Core Governance Principles

### 2.1 No Discussion by Design

The platform is **not a forum**.

There are:
- No comments
- No replies
- No debates
- No discussion threads

The platform exists to:
- Record decisions
- Publish outcomes
- Preserve records

This prevents conflict escalation and ambiguity.

### 2.2 Archive, Not Delete

Nothing of record is deleted.

Items are:
- Archived
- Locked
- Preserved for transparency

This applies to:
- Polls
- Documents
- Actions
- Communications
- Membership records
- Governance changes

Archived items remain accessible in read-only form.

### 2.3 Real-World Authority Comes First

The platform does **not** decide reality.

Examples:
- Plot ownership
- Membership eligibility
- Role suitability

These are verified **offline by the RG**.

The platform records the **outcome** of those real-world decisions.
